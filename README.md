# Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Q-Learning algorithm for solving the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym. The project demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning techniques to train an agent capable of successfully landing a spacecraft on the moon, handling tasks like controlling the lander's thrusters and managing its descent trajectory.

## About Deep Q-Learning

Deep Q-Learning is a powerful reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks. In this approach:

1. **Q-Learning**: A value-based algorithm that aims to find the optimal action-selection policy using a Q-table.
2. **Deep Neural Networks**: Replace the Q-table with a neural network to estimate Q-values for large or continuous state spaces.

This project applies the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to the Lunar Lander problem, training a neural network to predict the optimal actions the lander should take to achieve a soft landing.

## Features

- **Experience Replay**: Efficiently uses past experiences to stabilize learning.
- **Target Networks**: Improves stability by separating the target and training networks.
- **Reward Shaping**: Guides the agent's learning by assigning meaningful rewards.
- **Customizable Hyperparameters**: Allows tuning of learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate.
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes performance graphs and gameplay visualization.
